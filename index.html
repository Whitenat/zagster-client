        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>If you're having issues viewing the data try selecting and deselecting the key on each table</p>
        <p>This simple data visualization shows the total number of rides taken on Zagster bikes here in Bend OR since it’s introduction in September 2016 through October 2018 and then the number of rides taken at the individual stations available here in Bend. By referencing a database on “heropuapp.com” containing all of the collected zagster data and using the Chart.js library you can see in a simple line graph how the popularity of the bikes continues to grow! 

            What is interesting about the individual stations is that you can see the increased number of rides in 2018 is shown at all the stations individually and the overall spike isn’t just due to having more bikes available.
